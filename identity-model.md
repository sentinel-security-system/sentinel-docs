# Sentinel Identity Model

Sentinel uses a rotating, privacy-preserving identity system.

Key principles:
- No static identifiers are broadcast
- Device identity never leaves the device
- Broadcast identifiers rotate periodically
- Community scanners cannot identify owners

The system prevents long-term tracking while allowing
correlation of stolen-device sightings by the owner only.
